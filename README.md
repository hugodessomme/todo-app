# Todo App

Simple PHP application to manage tasks

## Purpose

I am developping this app to improve my PHP skills. Feedbacks are welcome !

## But why?

Several years ago, I sent my profile to a company for a developer internship. They asked me to develop what I will do in this repo, but I was not able to do it because of my knowledges at this time. I have kept their exercise until now, and from today, I will do it.

## And how?

As described in their file, I will respect usage of:

- [Limonade](https://github.com/sofadesign/limonade) : PHP micro framework
- [Bootstrap](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap): Front-end framework
- [jQuery](https://github.com/jquery/jquery): JavaScript library

### Requested features

- Register
- Login
- Tasks
    - List all tasks (with pagination)
    - CRUD (with Ajax): create, update, delete
    - Search
    - Filter by categories

Let's have fun!
